# Artistic Style Transfer
The codes are explained in the jupyter notebook with details explaination.

I have used pretrained VGG19 model which was trained on imagenet.

The model weights (`vgg19_weights_tf_dim_ordering_tf_kernels_notop.h5`) are present at the given location: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/keras/vgg19

The style images are taken from the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time

The content images are taken from the dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/duttadebadri/image-classification

Dataset and model weights have to be downloaded before running the code. All these data and VGG19 weights should be kept in a folder named `input`

## DEPENDENICIES
I am using keras from tensorflow. Other dependencies include numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy.
